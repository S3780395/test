          <p>This job requires the hired manager to explore the digital future within the entire company of AMG Petronas F1 Team to transform the way IT is used amongst the company. This will require having responsibility of the highest manner whilst being able to develop the infrastructure as quickly as their car. With such a high-grade job perfect efficiency and effective delivery is required whilst working with multiple teams to deliver to meet the highest of expectations from co-workers and performance indicators. This position to me is appealing as I have both a very high interest in IT itself and motorsport so a combination of the two would be a proper dream, even a single sector of either would be perfect, despite how demanding it appears it would be a great experience. The working hours would be very demanding at such a company, but the pay would highly likely balancing out considering the level of expertise they demand. Along with this I would have to move to Brackley in the UK to their headquarters and potentially towards each race. I doubt there would be any flexibility within the job but to balance it out, it would be very rewarding. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">The Required Skills</h2>

          <p>TThe required skills of such a calibre job are very high, a constant monitor of technology and infrastructure to never fall behind is a must, an understanding in Microsoft server infrastructures and office technologies plus Linux and open source is required. In addition to this being able to deliver different solutions using a mix of models and virtualisation technologies whilst being able to utilise different modern storage solutions involving data centres and networks paired with knowledge of office 365, Microsoft Azure. Aside from the technical details of the job, there are many social skills required for the position such as being able to work as a team with exceptional people management skills which will allow the team to remain motivated and happy whilst following their values of passion, respect, innovation, determination and excellence. The candidate must be motivated, highly organised, fast, analytically strong, calm and proactive to fill the role. </p>
          
          
          <h2 class="section-heading">My Current Skills</h2>

          <p>Such a job would not be one someone in their twenties would be able to achieve with such a vast amount of experience required. My skills certainly at the moment do not tick many of the technical boxes with potential exception of decent understanding of relevant technologies which could provide the company and office 365 knowledge. On the other hand my social skills are much more suited with experience from working in many teams which have often been difficult in school, university and jobs, people management skills gained from working in customer service which I often receive praise from, calmness in stressful situations, comfort in developing new skills and constant analytical skills gathered from a F1 style approach of learning where I would always take an overlook finding my weak points to develop which I have applied ever since implementation. Motivation can easily be found from simply caring empowering me to push forward and put 110% of my effort into such activity.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">How would I get there?</h2>

          <p>To gain and develop such requirements will take many years but to tackle such a feat, valuable time spent at university in possibly multiple courses to explore the required needs plus experience of working in similar roles but at a much lower level would hopefully lead to eventually have all the required skills to get a job of a similar position or even within a high level organisation would be perfect. </p>
